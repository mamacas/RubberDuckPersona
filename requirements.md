## Vision

### What is the vision of this product?
An interactive page of multiple choice questions that compound to determine the _"personality"_ or _"duck persona"_ of the user. 

### What pain point does this program solve?
This quiz will answer a question that most people did not know they had: what type of duck persona are you? This, like other personality quizzes, will allow a user to satisfy a curiosity they have about themselves. 

### Why should we care about your product?
We all love to be assessed and analyzed, and to identify with something. Who doesn't want to know their duck persona?
