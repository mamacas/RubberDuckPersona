                <p>I’m from Milwaukee, WI and have been in Seattle for 1.5 years. My background is in psychology and healthcare, but by the time I moved here, I knew I needed a career change. I decided to learn Software Development after speaking to enough developers who were happy with their jobs and were also using their skills as developers to create change in their communities. Ideally, after CodeFellows I’d like to continue my human-services-oriented work in a tech space.</p>

                <h3>Madison Stehle</h3>
                <h4>Title</h4>
                <p>Budding connoisseur of rubber ducks, devourer of the written word, and cursed with the gift of dry humor. The elves know her as [redacted], the dwarves know her as [redacted], but you know her as Madison. She has two fur-children, has hiked on volcanoes and waterfalls, regularly blasts her eardrums with heavy metal music, and is always looking for another book recommendation.</p>

                <h4>Mr. Clean</h4>
                <p>Military brat from Tennessee, but spent most of my life out here on the Left Coast, the past 32 years in the Tacoma area.  My professional background is strongly in commercial/industrial electronics / electro-mechanical repair, computer work (with light networking), with smatterings of machine shop work and inside sales.  On the personal side, moderate-to-severe tech-head (prefer 'Firefly' to 'Star Wars', but both are fun) and aspiring woodworking craftsman/Maker, writer, and tinkerer.  I'm looking to do something more beneficiall and impactful with my remaining professional career, and Software Development has come to be a good fit.  I'm looking to add Accessability techniques to whatever coding I move on to do, and would welcome the opportunity to come back to Code Fellows as another 'success story' and perhaps even teach a bit...?</p>
